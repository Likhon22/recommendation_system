Rice Blast,Symptoms,What are the symptoms of rice blast disease?,"Rice blast symptoms vary by plant part affected. Leaf blast appears as diamond-shaped lesions with gray centers and brown margins. Neck blast causes the panicle neck to rot and break, leading to unfilled grains. Node blast can cause stem breakage."
Rice Blast,Causes,What causes rice blast disease?,"Rice blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (formerly Pyricularia oryzae). The disease spreads through airborne spores and is favored by high humidity, moderate temperatures (20-30°C), and excessive nitrogen fertilization."
Rice Blast,Treatment,How can I treat rice blast?,"Treatment includes timely application of systemic fungicides such as tricyclazole, azoxystrobin, or isoprothiolane. Multiple applications may be needed at critical growth stages (tillering, booting, and heading). Reduce nitrogen fertilizer and improve field drainage."
Rice Blast,Prevention,How can I prevent rice blast?,"Prevention strategies include using resistant varieties, balanced fertilization (avoid excessive nitrogen), proper water management (avoid prolonged leaf wetness), wider plant spacing for better air circulation, and seed treatment with fungicides."
Rice Blast,Impact,What is the impact of rice blast on yield?,"Rice blast can cause severe yield losses ranging from 30% to 100% in susceptible varieties under favorable conditions. Neck blast is particularly damaging as it prevents grain filling, resulting in empty or partially filled panicles."
