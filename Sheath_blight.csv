Sheath blight,Symptoms,What are the symptoms of sheath blight?,"Sheath blight appears as oval or elliptical lesions on leaf sheaths near the water line. Lesions are initially greenish-gray, then develop white to gray centers with brown margins. The disease can spread upward to affect leaves and panicles, forming irregular patches in the field."
Sheath blight,Causes,What causes sheath blight?,"Sheath blight is caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani. The pathogen survives as sclerotia in soil and plant debris. Disease development is favored by high humidity, dense planting, excessive nitrogen, and stagnant water."
Sheath blight,Treatment,How can I treat sheath blight?,"Treatment includes application of fungicides such as validamycin, hexaconazole, or azoxystrobin at early infection stages. Apply fungicides when the first lesions appear near the waterline. Reduce plant density and nitrogen levels to improve air circulation."
Sheath blight,Prevention,How can I prevent sheath blight?,"Prevention measures include using moderately resistant varieties, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, maintaining proper plant spacing, alternate wetting and drying water management, removing crop residues, and applying silicon fertilizers to strengthen plant cell walls."
Sheath blight,Management,What are the best management practices for sheath blight?,"Integrated management includes: planting at recommended spacing (15-20 cm), balanced fertilization with emphasis on potassium and silicon, proper water management (avoid continuous flooding), using clean seeds, crop rotation with non-host crops, and timely fungicide application when needed."
