Sheath rot,Symptoms,What are the symptoms of sheath rot?,"Sheath rot symptoms include oblong or irregular spots on the uppermost leaf sheath that encloses young panicles. Lesions are initially reddish-brown, later becoming gray with brown margins. Infected sheaths may not allow panicles to emerge, or panicles may emerge partially with rotted, discolored grains."
Sheath rot,Causes,What causes sheath rot?,"Sheath rot is primarily caused by the fungus Sarocladium oryzae (formerly Acrocylindrium oryzae). Other fungi like Fusarium and Curvularia species can also be associated. High humidity, cloudy weather at booting stage, and insect damage predispose plants to infection."
Sheath rot,Treatment,How do I treat sheath rot?,"Treatment involves spraying fungicides containing carbendazim, propiconazole, or copper oxychloride at the boot leaf stage before panicle emergence. Two to three applications at 7-10 day intervals may be necessary. Improve field drainage and reduce nitrogen application."
Sheath rot,Prevention,How can I prevent sheath rot?,"Prevention includes using disease-free seeds, seed treatment with fungicides, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization especially at later growth stages, maintaining proper plant spacing, ensuring good field drainage, and controlling stem borers and other insects that create entry points for pathogens."
Sheath rot,Impact,What is the impact of sheath rot on rice production?,"Sheath rot can cause significant yield losses, especially when infection occurs early during booting stage. Affected panicles may fail to emerge completely, or grains may be chaffy, discolored, and of poor quality. Yield losses can range from 20-40% in severely affected fields."
